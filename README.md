## üèóÔ∏è Structure

This project adopts a multi-module approach to separate features and responsibilities, promoting scalability and maintainability.

-   **`app`**: The main application module that integrates all other modules to build the final APK.
-   **`feature`**: A group of modules, each representing a specific app feature.
    -   `feature:main`: Contains the UI and logic for the main to-do list screen.
    -   `feature:histories`: Contains the UI and logic for the completed tasks history screen.
-   **`core`**: A group of library modules that provide shared functionality across feature modules.
    -   `core:data`: Manages data sources and repository implementations.
    -   `core:domain`: Contains pure business logic, including UseCases and domain models.
    -   `core:database`: Manages Room DB setup, DAOs, and Entities.
    -   `core:navigation`: Manages navigation logic for screen transitions.
    -   `core:ui`: Contains common Composable UI components.
    -   `core:designsystem`: Defines the app's design system, including colors, typography, and themes.
    -   `core:security`: Handles data encryption logic.
-   **`build-logic`**: Manages Convention Plugins to standardize Gradle configurations across modules.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

-   **Clean Architecture**
    -   The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, separating concerns into three main layers: **Presentation (feature) - Domain - Data**. This ensures a decoupled, testable, and maintainable codebase.
-   **MVI (Model-View-Intent)**
    -   The Presentation Layer is implemented using the MVI pattern.
    -   **Model**: The `ViewModel` manages a single, immutable state object (e.g., `MainScreenState`) exposed via a `StateFlow`.
    -   **View**: The Composable UI observes the `StateFlow` and renders the screen accordingly.
    -   **Intent**: User actions are modeled as explicit `Intent`s (e.g., `MainScreenIntent`), which are processed by the `ViewModel` to produce a new state. This creates a predictable, unidirectional data flow.
-   **Key Technologies**
    -   **UI**: 100% Jetpack Compose
    -   **DI (Dependency Injection)**: Hilt
    -   **Database**: Room, SQLCipher
    -   **Asynchronous**: Coroutines, Flow
    -   **Navigation**: Navigation for Compose
    -   **Build**: Gradle, Version Catalogs, Convention Plugins
